# WeatherApplication
This project is a dynamic weather forecasting web application that fetches and displays live weather data for any city entered by the user. The app uses the OpenWeatherMap API and displays the city name, temperature, weather condition, humidity, and wind speed. It also updates an icon based on the current weather.
